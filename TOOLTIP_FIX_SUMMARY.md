# Tooltip Fix Summary

## Issue
Tooltips were disappearing immediately after appearing when hovering over chart markers.

## Root Cause
The tooltip was positioned too close to the cursor (only 15px offset), causing it to sometimes appear under the cursor path. This triggered an immediate mouseout event on the marker, hiding the tooltip.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Improved Tooltip Positioning** (`utils/chartTooltip.ts`)
- Increased offset from cursor: 20px horizontal, -10px vertical (slightly above)
- Added intelligent positioning that adjusts based on viewport boundaries
- Tooltip now avoids appearing under the cursor path
- Measures tooltip dimensions before final positioning

### 2. **Better Event Handling** (`utils/chart/markerRenderer.ts`)
- Changed from `mouseover/mouseout` to `mouseenter/mouseleave` events
- These events don't bubble and provide more stable hover behavior

### 3. **Added Hide Delay** (`utils/chart/chartTooltipManager.ts`)
- Added 100ms delay before hiding tooltips
- Prevents flickering when mouse moves quickly
- Clears pending hide timeouts when re-entering a marker

### 4. **Improved Z-Index**
- Increased tooltip z-index from 10000 to 99999 to ensure it's always on top

### 5. **Proper Cleanup**
- Updated ScatterPlot to use `ChartTooltipManager.cleanup()` for consistent behavior
- Ensures hide timeouts are cleared properly

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Hover over any chart marker
2. Tooltip should appear to the right and slightly above the cursor
3. Tooltip should remain visible while hovering
4. Moving between nearby markers should not cause flickering
5. Tooltip should adjust position near screen edges
