# Startup Animation V1.1 - Monochrome Theme

## Meta Information
- **Created**: 2025-06-24

- **Affected Components**: 
  - `/components/SplashScreen/SplashScreen.tsx`

## Overview
Updated the startup animation to match the application's monochrome aesthetic, replacing the colorful gradient theme with a sophisticated grayscale design.

## Details
### Background/Problem
The V1.0 splash screen used vibrant purple and blue colors that didn't match the monochrome design of the main application, creating a visual disconnect.

### Implementation
Changed all color elements to grayscale:

1. **Background**: 
   - From: `from-gray-900 via-blue-900 to-purple-900`
   - To: `from-zinc-950 via-zinc-900 to-zinc-800`

2. **Text Effects**:
   - Main "CAA" text: White to zinc gradient with white glow
   - Expanding text: White with softer shadows
   - Small text (hinami's, nalysis): `text-zinc-300`

3. **Visual Elements**:
   - Particles: Reduced opacity (0.2) with blur effect
   - Progress bar: `from-zinc-600 via-white to-zinc-600`
   - Loading dots: `bg-zinc-400`
   - Added subtle grid pattern overlay

4. **Shadow Effects**:
   - All colored shadows replaced with white/gray shadows
   - Maintained glow effects but in monochrome

### Technical Details
- Preserved all animation timings and behaviors
- Enhanced visual depth with blur effects on particles
- Added grid pattern for texture
- Maintained performance optimizations

## Visual Comparison
- **V1.0**: Colorful with purple/blue theme
- **V1.1**: Sophisticated monochrome with zinc/gray palette

## Testing
1. Verify all animations work as before
2. Check visual consistency with main app
3. Ensure no performance degradation
4. Test on light/dark themes if applicable

## Updates
### Timing Adjustments (2025-06-24)
- Reduced "CAA" display duration from 800ms to 500ms
- Accelerated overall animation sequence:
  - Initial → Expanding: 500ms (was 800ms)
  - Expanding → Complete: 1300ms (was 1800ms)
  - Complete → Fadeout: 2500ms (was 3300ms)
  - Total duration: 3000ms (was 3800ms)
- Faster individual animations:
  - CAA spring animation: 0.4s (was 0.6s)
  - Text expansion: 0.6s (was 0.8s)
  - Margin transitions: 0.3s (was 0.5s)

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding theme detection for light/dark mode
- Add subtle noise texture for more depth
- Possibility of user preference for color scheme
- Option to skip animation with key press
