## Overview
Implemented a cool startup animation for "Chinami's Analysis APP" that shows a text transformation from "CAA" to the full application name, along with visual effects and loading indicators.

## Details
### Background/Problem
The application loaded directly without any visual introduction, missing an opportunity to create a memorable first impression and brand identity.

### Implementation
Created a multi-stage splash screen animation:
1. **Initial Stage (0-800ms)**: Shows "CAA" with spring animation and glow effects
2. **Expanding Stage (800-1800ms)**: Transforms "CAA" into "Chinami's Analysis APP" with smooth text expansion
3. **Complete Stage (1800-3300ms)**: Shows full app name with subtitle, progress bar, and loading indicators
4. **Fadeout Stage (3300-3800ms)**: Smooth transition to main application

### Technical Details
- Used Framer Motion for animations
- Implemented with React hooks for stage management
- Fixed hydration issues by deferring splash screen display until after mount
- Created background particle effects and animated gradients
- Responsive design that handles different screen sizes
- Total duration: ~3.8 seconds
- Shows on every app launch for consistent experience

## Usage
The splash screen automatically shows on every app launch.


### Animation Behavior
The animation plays on every app launch for a consistent brand experience.

## Impact
- No impact on existing functionality
- Adds ~100KB to bundle size (Framer Motion dependency)
- Enhances user experience with professional branding
- Creates memorable first impression

## Testing
1. Reload the application
2. Verify animation stages play in sequence:
   - CAA initial display with spring effect
   - Text expansion to full name
   - Loading indicators appear
   - Smooth fade to main app
3. Test on different screen sizes
4. Verify no hydration errors in console

## Future Improvements
- Add skip button for impatient users
- Consider reducing animation duration based on user feedback
- Add sound effects (optional, with user preference)
- Create seasonal variations for special occasions
