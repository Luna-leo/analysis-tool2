## Overview
Fixed multiple issues with reference lines:
1. Reference lines with "Range: Auto" setting were being cut off at the chart boundaries instead of extending infinitely across the visible area
2. Reference lines were disappearing when panning or zooming the chart
3. Implemented clipping to ensure reference lines stay within the plot area boundaries

## Details
### Background/Problem
Multiple issues with reference lines:
1. When users created reference lines and set the range to "Auto", the lines would only extend to the chart's inner boundaries
2. When panning or zooming the chart, reference lines would disappear completely
3. Lines were extending beyond the plot area after the initial fix

### Root Cause Analysis
The pan/zoom issue occurred because:
- ChartPreviewGraph was calling `svg.selectAll("*").remove()` on every re-render
- This deleted all SVG elements including the reference-lines-layer
- ReferenceLines component wasn't re-rendering because zoomVersion wasn't in its dependencies

### Implementation
1. **Added range properties to ReferenceLine type**: Added `xRange` and `yRange` properties to store the range configuration
2. **Updated conversion logic**: Modified ParametersTab to preserve range settings when converting between UI configuration and data model
3. **Extended line rendering**: 
   - Modified HorizontalReferenceLine to extend the line 1000px beyond the chart area on both sides when `xRange.auto` is true
   - Modified VerticalReferenceLine to extend the line 1000px beyond the chart area on top and bottom when `yRange.auto` is true
4. **Added clipping to reference lines layer**:
   - Created a clipPath that matches the plot area dimensions
   - Applied the clipPath to the reference-lines-layer to ensure lines don't overflow the plot area
5. **Fixed pan/zoom issue**:
   - Modified ChartPreviewGraph to preserve reference-lines-layer and defs during re-renders
   - Changed from `svg.selectAll("*").remove()` to selective removal that keeps essential elements
   - This ensures reference lines remain visible during pan/zoom operations

### Technical Details
- The `xRange` and `yRange` properties match the structure used in the UI configuration
- When `xRange.auto` is true for horizontal lines, the line is drawn from `x1 = -1000` to `x2 = width + 1000`
- When `yRange.auto` is true for vertical lines, the line is drawn from `y1 = -1000` to `y2 = height + 1000`
- The interactive area for dragging also extends to match the visual line
- A clipPath is created with dimensions matching the plot area (width Ã— height)
- The clipPath is applied to the reference-lines-layer group to ensure lines stay within boundaries
- Lines appear to extend to the edges but are clipped at the plot area boundaries

## Usage
1. Add a reference line (horizontal or vertical) in the chart editor
2. Click the "Range" button for the line
3. Ensure "Auto Range" is checked (default)
4. The line will now extend across the entire visible chart area

## Impact
- No breaking changes - existing reference lines will default to auto range
- The fix affects both horizontal and vertical reference lines
- Dragging and label positioning continue to work as before

## Testing
1. Create a new chart with data
2. Add both horizontal and vertical reference lines
3. Verify they extend across the full chart area (width for horizontal, height for vertical)
4. Test with different chart sizes and zoom levels
5. Test dragging the lines and their labels
6. Test switching between auto and custom range for both line types
7. **Pan/Zoom Testing**:
   - Pan the chart by dragging - verify reference lines remain visible
   - Zoom in/out using mouse wheel - verify reference lines stay in correct positions
   - Use zoom controls - verify reference lines are preserved
   - Double-click to reset zoom - verify reference lines remain

## Future Improvements
- The 1000px extension could be made configurable if necessary
- Consider adding visual indicators when lines extend beyond the visible area
