## Overview
Improved reference line implementation by adding conditional console output, optimizing MutationObserver, and enhancing type definitions.

## Details
### Background/Problem
After analyzing the reference line implementation, several optimization opportunities were identified:
- Console warnings were being output in production, potentially impacting performance
- MutationObserver was monitoring all child element changes unnecessarily
- Type definitions could be strengthened for better error handling

### Implementation
1. **Conditional Console Warnings**
   - Wrapped all console.warn statements with `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` checks
   - 5 warnings in VerticalReferenceLine.tsx
   - 2 warnings in HorizontalReferenceLine.tsx
   - Production builds now have zero console output from reference lines

2. **MutationObserver Optimization**
   - Modified observer to only check elements added after the labels layer
   - Added index-based checking to determine if an element needs attention
   - Early return if labels node is not found
   - Reduced unnecessary DOM operations

3. **Enhanced Type Definitions**
   - Added `ReferenceLineError` interface for structured error handling
   - Added `ScaleValidationResult` for scale validation results
   - Added `DragState` interface for better drag state management
   - Reorganized type exports in constants file

### Technical Details
The MutationObserver now uses Array.from() to get element indices and only triggers the raise operation when elements are actually added after the labels layer, significantly reducing the number of times the callback runs.

## Usage
No API changes - all improvements are internal optimizations that maintain backward compatibility.

## Impact
- Eliminated console output in production environments
- Reduced MutationObserver overhead
- Improved type safety for future development
- Better structured error handling capabilities

## Testing
1. Verify no console warnings appear in production build
2. Test reference line label positioning remains correct
3. Confirm drag operations work as expected
4. Check that labels stay on top when other SVG elements are added

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing the enhanced error types for user-facing error messages
- Potential for further common logic extraction between vertical and horizontal implementations
- Performance monitoring to quantify the impact of these optimizations
