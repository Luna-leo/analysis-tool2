## Overview
Inverted the color scheme from dark (black background) to light (white background) for a cleaner, more modern appearance.

## Details
### Background/Problem
The dark theme splash screen didn't match well with certain use cases and environments where a lighter, cleaner aesthetic was preferred.

### Implementation
Complete color inversion:

1. **Background**: 
   - From: `from-zinc-950 via-zinc-900 to-zinc-800` (dark)
   - To: `from-white via-zinc-50 to-zinc-100` (light)

2. **Text Colors**:
   - CAA gradient: `from-zinc-900 to-zinc-600` (dark text)
   - Main text: `text-zinc-900` (was white)
   - Subtext: `text-zinc-600` (was zinc-300)

3. **Visual Elements**:
   - Particles: `bg-black/5` (was white/5)
   - Shadows: Black with reduced opacity
   - Progress bar: Dark gradient on light background
   - Loading dots: `bg-zinc-600`

4. **Effects**:
   - Text shadows: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1-0.2)`
   - Gradient overlay: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)`
   - Particle opacity: 0.1 (slightly reduced)

### Technical Details
- Maintained all animation timings and behaviors from previous versions
- Adjusted opacity values for optimal contrast on light background
- Shadow intensities reduced for subtler effect on white

## Visual Impact
- Clean, professional appearance
- Better visibility in bright environments
- Modern, minimalist aesthetic
- Consistent with light-themed applications

## Testing
1. Verify text readability on white background
2. Check contrast ratios for accessibility
3. Ensure animations remain smooth
4. Test in different lighting conditions

## Future Improvements
- Auto-detect system theme preference
- Toggle between light/dark themes
- Accessibility mode with higher contrast
