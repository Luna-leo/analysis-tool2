# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring performed on the input history feature and related components.

## 1. Input History Store (`useInputHistoryStore.ts`)

### Improvements:
- **Extracted common logic**: Created `addToHistory` helper function to eliminate code duplication
- **Added TypeScript documentation**: Added JSDoc comments for interfaces and functions
- **Enhanced functionality**: Added individual clear methods for plant and machine history
- **Better code organization**: Grouped related functionality with clear comments

### Key Features:
- Persists to localStorage with key 'input-history-storage'
- Maintains up to 20 items per category
- Sorts by usage frequency
- Tracks usage count and last used timestamp

## 2. InputCombobox Component (`input-combobox.tsx`)

### Improvements:
- **Added comprehensive TypeScript documentation**: JSDoc comments for props and component
- **Performance optimization**: 
  - Used `useCallback` for event handlers
  - Used `useMemo` for filtered suggestions
- **Better state management**: Clear separation of concerns with focused state variables
- **Improved readability**: Descriptive function names and clear comments

### Key Features:
- Smooth dropdown interaction (fixed initial click issue)
- Real-time filtering of suggestions
- Support for custom values
- Keyboard and mouse friendly

## 3. PlantMachineFields Component (`PlantMachineFields.tsx`)

### Improvements:
- **Added React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **TypeScript documentation**: Clear prop descriptions
- **Better naming**: More descriptive component and prop documentation

### Key Features:
- Reusable across multiple dialogs
- Automatic history saving on successful operations
- Disabled state support for edit mode

## 4. Chart Axis Positioning

### Created New Utility (`axisPositioning.ts`):
- **Extracted logic**: Centralized X-axis positioning calculation
- **Reusable functions**: 
  - `calculateXAxisPosition`: Calculates Y position for X-axis
  - `shouldXAxisBeAtZero`: Determines if X-axis should be at y=0
- **Type safety**: Proper TypeScript types for all parameters

### Updated Chart Components:
- LineChart, ScatterPlot, and EmptyChart now use the shared utility
- Consistent behavior across all chart types
- Easier to maintain and extend

## 5. Code Quality Improvements

### TypeScript Enhancements:
- Added JSDoc comments throughout
- Proper interface documentation
- Clear parameter and return type descriptions

### Performance Optimizations:
- React.memo for PlantMachineFields
- useCallback hooks for event handlers
- useMemo for computed values

### Maintainability:
- DRY principle applied (removed duplicated logic)
- Single responsibility for each function
- Clear naming conventions
- Modular design

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Better Developer Experience**:
   - Clear documentation makes code self-explanatory
   - Centralized logic reduces cognitive load
   - Type safety prevents runtime errors

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimized event handlers
   - Efficient filtering operations

3. **Easier Maintenance**:
   - Changes to axis positioning logic only need to be made in one place
   - Input history logic is centralized and reusable
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Enhanced Extensibility**:
   - Easy to add new history categories
   - Simple to extend axis positioning logic
   - Reusable components for future features

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test `addToHistory` function with various inputs
   - Test axis positioning calculations
   - Test InputCombobox event handlers

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test history persistence across page reloads
   - Test dropdown interaction flows
   - Test chart rendering with various Y-axis domains

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Verify memo effectiveness
   - Check rendering performance with large suggestion lists
   - Test with maximum history items (20)
