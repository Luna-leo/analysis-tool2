# React Performance Optimizations Summary

This document summarizes the React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback optimizations applied to frequently rendered components.

## Components Optimized with React.memo

### 1. Card Components
- **FormulaCard** (`/components/formula-master/FormulaCard.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Memoized click handlers with useCallback
  
- **TriggerConditionCard** (`/components/trigger-condition-master/TriggerConditionCard.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  - Memoized complexity calculation with useMemo
  - Memoized all event handlers with useCallback
  
- **ChartCard** (`/components/charts/ChartCard.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  - Memoized mouse event handlers and edit handler with useCallback
  
- **UnitConverterFormulaCard** (`/components/unit-converter-formula/UnitConverterFormulaCard.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  - Memoized sample conversion calculation with useMemo
  - Memoized all event handlers with useCallback
  
- **ConditionEditorCard** (`/components/condition-editor/ConditionEditorCard.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo

### 2. Chart Components
- **ChartPreview** (`/components/charts/ChartPreview.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  
- **ChartPreviewGraph** (`/components/charts/ChartPreviewGraph.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  
- **ChartPreviewInfo** (`/components/charts/ChartPreviewInfo.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo

### 3. Table Components
- **MasterPageTable** (`/components/master-page/MasterPageTable.tsx`)
  - Created separate TableRow component with React.memo
  - Memoized getStickyStyle function with useCallback
  - Memoized row event handlers
  
- **MasterPageVirtualTable** (`/components/master-page/MasterPageVirtualTable.tsx`)
  - Created separate VirtualTableRow component with React.memo
  - Memoized visible items calculation with useMemo
  - Memoized getStickyStyle and handleScroll with useCallback

### 4. List Components
- **SavedConditionsList** (`/components/search/SavedConditionsList.tsx`)
  - Created separate SavedConditionItem component with React.memo
  - Memoized item event handlers with useCallback
  
- **FileListDisplay** (`/components/csv-import/FileListDisplay.tsx`)
  - Created separate FileItem component with React.memo

### 5. Row Components
- **ParameterRow** (`/components/charts/EditModal/parameters/ParameterRow/index.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  - Memoized type change and remove handlers with useCallback
  
- **ReferenceLineRow** (`/components/charts/EditModal/parameters/ReferenceLineRow.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  - Memoized all input change handlers with useCallback
  
- **ThresholdTableRow** (`/components/charts/EditModal/parameters/ThresholdPointsTable/ThresholdTableRow.tsx`)
  - Added React.memo
  - Created separate ThresholdCell component with React.memo
  - Memoized all event handlers with useCallback

## Key Optimization Patterns Applied

1. **React.memo for Pure Components**: Applied to components that only need to re-render when their props change

2. **useCallback for Event Handlers**: Memoized callback functions to prevent child components from re-rendering due to new function references

3. **useMemo for Expensive Computations**: Used for calculations that don't need to be recalculated on every render (e.g., complexity calculations, sample conversions)

4. **Component Extraction**: Extracted list items and table rows into separate memoized components to optimize rendering of large lists

5. **Dependency Arrays**: Carefully managed dependency arrays to ensure proper memoization without stale closures

## Performance Benefits

- Reduced unnecessary re-renders in lists and tables
- Improved performance when scrolling through large datasets
- Better performance in forms with many input fields
- Optimized chart rendering and updates
- Reduced memory allocation from recreating functions on each render

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. Consider implementing virtualization for very large lists
2. Add performance monitoring to measure the impact
3. Consider using React.lazy for code splitting of heavy components
4. Implement debouncing for frequently changing inputs
